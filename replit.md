Quero um processo de desenvolvimento iterativo.
Pergunte antes de fazer mudanças arquiteturais significativas.
Garanta que o código seja bem documentado e legível.
Foque em boas práticas de segurança.
Prefiro um design de UI limpo e minimalista.
Garanta que todos os textos voltados ao usuário estejam em português gramaticalmente correto com acentuação adequada.
CRÍTICO: NUNCA perca funcionalidades existentes ao fazer mudanças. Sempre verifique se as funcionalidades implementadas anteriormente permanecem intactas. Antes de modificar qualquer componente, revise quais funcionalidades existem e garanta que sejam preservadas. Chame o architect para validar mudanças de UX.
GUIDELINE DE ERROS: Mensagens de erro genéricas ("Ocorreu um erro interno") NUNCA devem ser a resposta final ao usuário. O middleware deve incluir o tipo do erro e, quando seguro, a mensagem real. Filtrar dados sensíveis (password, token, secret). O modelo SQLAlchemy usa `source_file_path` (não `file_path`) para o caminho do arquivo do material.

## System Architecture
The application is built using FastAPI with a modular architecture.

**UI/UX Decisions:** The design system features a minimizable vertical sidebar, light theme, and Inter font. Global CSS centralizes styling, navigation is dynamic based on user roles, and a custom toast notification system provides consistent feedback. Modern React + Tailwind screens use Tailwind Preflight and utilities for spacing and styling, ensuring a modern SaaS-style user experience.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **AI Agent (Stevan) — Pipeline V2 Agentic RAG:** Uses OpenAI function calling for iterative tool use (MAX_ITERATIONS=3). GPT decides when to search, and tools include `search_knowledge_base`, `search_web`, `lookup_fii_public`, `send_document`, and `send_payoff_diagram`. Parallel tool execution is supported. **Source Separation Architecture:** Live market data (cotação, DY, P/VP, volume, índices) is fetched proactively from web/FundsExplorer without asking permission. Strategic data (preço-alvo, racional, tese, recomendação) comes from the internal knowledge base with mandatory source citation. Mixed queries combine both sources. All numeric citations require "(Fonte: [document/site name])".
- **Visual Reference System:** Automatically sends chart images from PDF reports alongside text responses when the query matches visual triggers (e.g., rentabilidade, distribuição, performance). Architecture: `visual_cache` table (BYTEA in PostgreSQL) stores extracted chart crops from PDFs; GPT-4 Vision locates chart bounding boxes; `should_send_visual()` uses deterministic keyword-based decision (not LLM). Limit: 1 image per response. Works in both WhatsApp (via Z-API send_image with Base64) and Testar Agente (inline rendering). `content_blocks.visual_description` field stores narrative descriptions of graphic blocks. Key files: `services/visual_extractor.py`, `services/visual_decision.py`. Cache endpoint: `GET /api/products/visual-cache/{block_id}/image` (auth required).
- **Semantic Search (RAG V3.2 Enhanced):** Utilizes `pgvector` and OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` with hybrid ranking, intelligent ticker detection, a financial glossary for query expansion, and semantic enrichment. Content blocks with JSON tabular data are resolved at query time. Temporal Reference Enrichment enhances content blocks lacking temporal context. **EntityResolver (Layer 0):** Pre-pipeline relational resolution of query terms to `product_ids` via the `products` table (ticker exact → name ILIKE → aliases). `search_by_product_ids()` fetches content blocks via ORM (Product→Material→ContentBlock), independent of `product_ticker` in embeddings. Ambiguous terms safelist prevents false positives. TICKER_PATTERN expanded to support stocks (`[A-Z]{4}[3-9|10-13]`), not just FIIs. Admin backfill endpoint at `/api/products/admin/backfill-product-data`.
- **Manager Disambiguation V2 (GPT-driven):** GPT-4o semantically determines if a user query refers to a financial manager, replacing substring matching to avoid false positives.
- **AI Document Summaries:** Automatic conceptual summaries and theme generation for documents using GPT-4o-mini.
- **Semantic Transformer:** A 3-layer architecture for technical extraction, semantic modeling, and narrative chunk generation for RAG indexing.
- **XPI Derivatives System:** A knowledge base for structured products with a 4-step conversational disambiguation flow, including content extracted via GPT-4 Vision and payoff diagrams.
- **External FIIs Query:** Fetches public FII data from FundsExplorer.com.br.
- **WhatsApp Integration:** Uses Z-API for various message types, logs interactions, and provides a "Message Center" interface. Supports full media processing (audio transcription with Whisper, image/document analysis). Includes message debounce, persistent conversation history, and hierarchical memory. The agent autonomously decides tool usage for actions like sending documents. Human handoff triggers ticket creation. **Z-API Webhook Auth:** Z-API sends `z-api-token` header (instance token), NOT `client-token`. Webhook validates against both `ZAPI_TOKEN` and `ZAPI_CLIENT_TOKEN`. CRITICAL: Never add security validation to `/api/webhook/zapi` without testing with real Z-API payloads first — this endpoint is the sole entry point for all WhatsApp messages.
- **Testar Agente:** A testing environment that mirrors the WhatsApp integration's Pipeline V2, including `generate_response_v2` and in-memory session summaries.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** JWT-based with role-based access control, JWT hardening, rate limiting, account lockout, and comprehensive security headers.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development) with SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Admin Panel:** Provides tools for user, integration, advisor, and campaign management, a "Message Center," and knowledge base management.
- **Product CMS:** Manages products, materials, and content blocks. Features include PDF upload with GPT-4 Vision extraction, approval system, semantic indexing, WhatsApp scripts, versioning, and validity control. **PDF Storage Architecture:** `material_files` (BYTEA in PostgreSQL) is the **single source of truth** for PDF availability. `source_file_path` is only a temporary disk cache (ephemeral on Railway). All "has PDF?" checks must query `material_files`, never `source_file_path`. All upload/ingestion flows must ensure `material_files` is populated. The `/api/files/{id}/download` endpoint serves PDFs from `material_files`. The `_restore_pdf_from_db` function restores PDFs from `material_files` to disk when needed for processing. A public download endpoint is available. The "SmartUpload" interface unifies pending materials management, including duplicate detection and bulk re-upload.
- **Intelligent Upload with Metadata Extraction:** `DocumentMetadataExtractor` service uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze PDFs and extract metadata. Adaptive DPI is used for PDF rendering. Resume-upload functionality and startup cleanup for stale processing jobs are implemented.
- **Dependency Health Check:** Validates critical dependencies on startup and provides real-time status via `/api/health/detailed`. Z-API and OpenAI health are monitored with background loops and cached statuses.
- **Bot & Z-API Error Visibility:** The UI provides visual indicators and banners for bot errors (e.g., OpenAI quota exhausted) and Z-API disconnection, with an option to acknowledge critical alerts. Message status indicators track outbound message delivery.
- **OpenAI Health Monitoring:** Monitors OpenAI API status, particularly for quota exhaustion, with recovery checks and administrative acknowledgment options.
- **Observability and Auditing:** Includes `RetrievalLog` for RAG searches, `IngestionLog` for document ingestion, RAG analytics, and content block tracking.
- **AI Agent Response Framework:** Utilizes a `ConversationState` machine, message normalization, contact identification, and AI-based intent classification for human transfer.
- **Escalation Intelligence V2.1:** GPT analysis on escalations with categorization and automatic ticket summary generation.
- **Bot Resolution Tracking V2.2:** Tracks bot-resolved conversations and metrics.
- **Separate Ticket Architecture V2.3:** Separates `Conversation` and `ConversationTicket` models for distinct historical data.
- **Insights Dashboard:** A management dashboard for Variable Income with `ConversationInsight` model, post-conversation GPT analysis, classification categories, dynamic filters, KPI cards, Chart.js graphs, rankings, and campaign summaries.
- **Web Search:** Fallback for real-time market data using Tavily AI, with a whitelist of trusted sources and an audit log.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Migrated to Railway via GitHub, using a Dockerfile with `python:3.12-slim`. React frontend assets are pre-compiled and committed to the repository for deployment.
- **Campaign Structures with Temporal Validity:** Manages active derivative campaigns with temporal filtering, auto-injecting active campaigns into Stevan's system prompt. Campaign-specific diagrams override generic ones. A frontend management page provides CRUD interface.
- **Unified Campaign System with Cadence:** Campaign sending unified into a single `/campanhas` page with two delivery modes: "Imediato" (SSE-based, real-time) and "Com Cadência" (anti-block, background motor). Campaign model extended with `delivery_mode`, `daily_limit`, `deadline_days`. CampaignDispatch extended with `scheduled_for`, `priority`, `responded_at`, `retry_count`. Cadence motor (`cadence_controller.py`) processes both legacy `cadence_campaign_contacts` and unified `campaign_dispatches`. Features: priority-based contact ordering (P1=recent msg, P2=any history, P3=cold), business hours (09h-18h), 8min min between sends, max 15 cold contacts/day, pause/resume with re-scheduling, response tracking via webhook, Chart.js dashboard with 60s auto-refresh. Legacy `/cadence-campaigns` route redirects to `/campanhas`. Key endpoints: `POST /api/campaigns/{id}/dispatch-cadence`, `GET /api/campaigns/{id}/cadence-status`, `PATCH /api/campaigns/{id}/cadence-pause`, `PATCH /api/campaigns/{id}/cadence-resume`. Key files: `services/campaign_planner.py` (planning), `services/cadence_controller.py` (execution), `api/endpoints/campaigns.py` (API), `frontend/templates/campanhas.html` (unified UI).
