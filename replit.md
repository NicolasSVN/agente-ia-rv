# Agente IA - RV - Agente de IA para Assessores Financeiros

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive FastAPI application designed as an AI agent for financial advisors. It aims to streamline communication, knowledge retrieval, and client management for financial advisory services. The system integrates with WhatsApp via Z-API (migrated from WAHA API), leverages semantic search on a Notion-based knowledge base using ChromaDB and OpenAI embeddings, and features an administrative dashboard. This dashboard includes a Kanban ticket system, user management with JWT authentication, and analytics for performance tracking. The project vision is to enhance advisor efficiency, improve client interaction, and provide robust tools for managing advisory operations.

## System Architecture

The application is built using FastAPI, leveraging a modular project structure.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System:** A complete redesign incorporates a new system with a minimizable vertical sidebar, light theme, and the Inter font.
- **Global CSS:** `frontend/static/global.css` centralizes styling with CSS Custom Properties for colors (e.g., `--primary-color: #4f46e5`), typography, and reusable components like `.card`, `.btn`, and `.modal`.
- **Navigation:** A dynamic sidebar adjusts visibility based on user roles, and its state is persisted using `localStorage`.
- **Modals:** Standardized modal structures are used for consistent user experience.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **AI Agent:** Integrates OpenAI for embeddings and chat, allowing real-time configuration of personality, rules, restrictions, AI model (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo), temperature, and response length via the `/agent-brain` panel.
- **Semantic Search:** Utilizes ChromaDB for vector storage and OpenAI embeddings to enable semantic search over a Notion knowledge base. Documents are chunked and indexed in the background.
- **WhatsApp Integration:** Uses Z-API for communication, processing various message types (text, audio, image, document, video) and logging all interactions in `whatsapp_messages` table. Features a "Central de Mensagens" interface styled like WhatsApp Web with real-time polling updates. Implements full LID (WhatsApp privacy identifier) support: stores senderLid and chatLid from webhooks, prioritizes LID lookups over phone numbers, and uses fallback chain (phone → chat_lid → sender_lid) for conversation identification.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based authentication secures API endpoints. User roles (`admin`, `gestao_rv`, `broker`, `client`) define access levels, with dynamic menu adjustments.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development) managed with SQLAlchemy ORM, defining models for users, tickets, agent configurations, message templates, campaigns, and knowledge documents.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Provides comprehensive tools for:
    - **User Management:** CRUD operations for users.
    - **Integration Management:** Configure and test external API keys (OpenAI, Notion, Z-API) directly from the UI, with temporary in-memory storage and Replit Secrets persistence. Z-API requires instance_id, token, and client_token.
    - **Kanban Ticket System:** For managing client inquiries with statuses and categories.
    - **Analytics:** Dashboard displaying KPIs (Total Interactions, Open/Closed Tickets, Messages Sent, Assessors Impacted), categorized inquiries, and average resolution time per broker, with date filtering.
    - **Assessor Base:** CRUD operations for managing financial advisors, with email as required unique identifier, custom fields, and bulk import via Excel/CSV with flexible column mapping. Email is used as the primary key for cross-referencing between campaigns and the assessor database.
    - **Campaign Management:** A 4-step wizard for mass WhatsApp message campaigns with two origin modes:
        - **Upload Mode:** Import CSV/Excel with data for personalized messages with variable mapping
        - **Base Selection Mode:** Select assessors directly from the database with filters (unidade, equipe) and checkboxes for quick informational broadcasts
        - **Step 3 Message Composer:** Blank message by default, dynamic variable panel showing available fields from data source, click-to-insert variables, attachment upload (images, videos, audio, documents up to 50MB), real-time variable validation with warnings for unavailable variables
        - **Template System:** Create, edit, and reuse message templates with attachments, automatic variable detection, and usage tracking
        - Features: Reusable templates, dynamic variables, intelligent grouping, attachment support via Z-API, and real-time dispatch progress via Server-Sent Events (SSE) with retry mechanisms. Supports delayMessage (1-15 seconds) for natural sending rhythm.
    - **Central de Mensagens:** WhatsApp Web-style interface for managing all conversations. Features real-time polling, message history grouped by phone number, human takeover capability, and ability to start new conversations with any phone number via modal.
    - **Knowledge Base Management:** Upload, index, categorize, and reindex documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, images) for the AI agent to consult.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Agent Configuration:** Dynamic control over AI behavior parameters.
- **Real-time Campaign Dispatch:** SSE for progress updates and retry logic during mass messaging.
- **Document Processing:** Background indexing of knowledge base documents with chunking and embedding generation.
- **Customizable Fields:** Dynamic custom fields for assessor profiles and campaign data.
- **Automated Bootstrap:** Admin user creation and configuration via environment variables.

**AI Agent Response Framework (services/conversation_flow.py):**
- **Conversation State Machine:** Uses `ConversationState` enum with 3 states:
  - `IDENTIFICATION_PENDING`: Contato desconhecido, aguardando identificação
  - `READY`: Contato identificado, pronto para processar mensagens
  - `IN_PROGRESS`: Conversa em andamento com contexto ativo
- **Message Normalization:** `normalize_message()` remove ruídos, emojis, espaços extras antes de processar
- **Contact Identification Flow:**
  - `identify_contact()` busca por telefone ou LID na tabela Assessor
  - `persist_new_contact()` cria novo contato com email/codigo_ai automáticos (whatsapp_{digits}@auto.contato)
  - Variações de frases para solicitar identificação de forma natural
- **Integrated Classification:** Prompt do agente classifica internamente em 4 categorias:
  - SAUDAÇÃO: Cumprimentos e mensagens iniciais
  - ESCOPO: Perguntas dentro do domínio do agente
  - DOCUMENTAL: Questões que requerem consulta à base de conhecimento
  - FORA_ESCOPO: Perguntas fora do domínio do agente
- **Human Transfer Criteria:** `should_transfer_to_human()` avalia:
  - Solicitação explícita do usuário
  - Fricção emocional (frustração, reclamações)
  - Contador de interações sem progresso (stalled_interactions)
- **Response Variations:** Funções para evitar respostas mecânicas:
  - `get_identification_prompt()`: Variações para solicitar identificação
  - `get_transfer_message()`: Variações para comunicar transferência
  - `get_out_of_scope_redirect()`: Variações para redirecionar perguntas fora do escopo

- **Z-API:** Integrates WhatsApp messaging capabilities via `https://api.z-api.io/instances/{ID}/token/{TOKEN}/` with Client-Token header authentication. Handles inbound (ReceivedCallback webhook) and outbound communications.
- **PostgreSQL:** Primary relational database for persistent storage (can default to SQLite for local development).
- **ChromaDB:** Vector database used for efficient semantic search on knowledge base embeddings.
- **Jinja2:** Templating engine for rendering HTML frontends.
